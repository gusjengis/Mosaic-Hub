# Mosaic Hub
This is the frontend for Mosaic, a personal project I'm using to collect autobiographical data.
The idea is that I can make notes throughout my day as well as automatically collect all kinds of other data about what I'm doing, then view it all on a timeline interface.

There are several other repos that are involved in the infrastructure for this app (I guess that's why it's called Mosaic):
[Mosaic-Model](https://github.com/gusjengis/Mosaic-Model)
[Mosaic-Backend](https://github.com/gusjengis/Mosaic-Backend)
[Mosaic-Android](https://github.com/gusjengis/Mosaic-Android)

There is also a postgres DB, which isn't a repo, and there is the whole Plinth stack, which I created just for this frontend.

### Plinth
This repo is another example of my Plinth stack. See [Plinth-Hello-World](https://github.com/gusjengis/Plinth-Hello-World) for a more basic example. I used that repo as my template when creating this one.
